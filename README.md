# Try Out VS Cloud Environments: Java â˜•

This is a sample project that lets you try out VS Cloud Environments in a few easy steps.
   
## Things to try

This sample has been cloned into your VS Cloud Environment. You're able to work with it like you would any local code.

Some things to try:

1. **Install language extensions**
  - Open `src/main/java/com/mycompany/app/App.java`
  - Install the recommended Java extension
  - View the list of `Cloud Environment - Installed` extensions
    > Note: The Java extension has been installed in the remote environment
  - Reload VS Code
    > Note: VS Code automatically reconnects to your cloud environment

2. **Edit code:**
   - Open `src/main/java/com/mycompany/app/App.java`
   - Try adding some code and check out the IntelliSense

3. **Terminal:** 
  - Press ctrl+shift+[backtick] to open the terminal
  - From the terminal run `java -version`
    > Note: java is not installed on the local machine, yet you're able to use it! 
  - Type other Linux commands (`uname`, `ls`, etc.) to interact with the underlying environment
    > Note: The local machine is Windows, yet you're able to issue Linux commands! 

4. **Build, Run, and Debug:**
   - Open `src/main/java/com/mycompany/app/App.java`
   - Change the message to "Hello {your name} from Java!"
   - Add a breakpoint
   - Press F5 to launch the app
   - Once the breakpoint is hit, try hovering over variables, examining locals, and other debugging tasks
   - Open Debug Console and show the booth attendant the output message

5. **Run a Test:**
   - Open `src/test/java/com/mycompany/app/AppTest.java`
   - Put a breakpoint in a test
   - Click the `Debug Test` in the Code Lens above the function and watch it hit the breakpoint

6. **Finish**
  - Complete steps 5-7 on the Challenge Worksheet
